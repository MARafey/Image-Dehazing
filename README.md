Once you have installed these necessary components, you will be well-equipped to run the code smoothly and experience the image defogging capabilities of this innovative software.

### File name structure
Upon downloading the provided zip file, you will find two essential components: the backend and frontend folders.

1. Backend:
The *backend* folder is home to the meticulously trained models utilized for image defogging, a cutting-edge process to enhance the clarity of images captured in adverse atmospheric conditions. Alongside these models, you will also encounter a pivotal main.py script. Running this script is crucial as it sets the foundation for the seamless operation of the subsequent React application.

2. Frontend:
Within the *frontend* folder, you will encounter the React code, an advanced and popular JavaScript library for crafting dynamic and responsive user interfaces. This well-crafted frontend code incorporates interactive elements, appealing visuals, and a user-friendly interface. Notably, it is artfully connected to the formidable models stored in the backend folder, ensuring a harmonious integration between the frontend and the powerful defogging algorithms.

By combining the prowess of the backend and frontend components, this software presents an impressive and innovative solution for image defogging, elevating the visual quality of images under challenging environmental conditions
